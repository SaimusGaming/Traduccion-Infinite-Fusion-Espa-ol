I have studied the Sinnoh myths extensively and I believe that there exist Pokémon that could excert this sort of power. 
But this begs the question: Why Mt. Silver, of all places?
Pero surge la pregunta: ¿Por qué el Monte Plateado, de entre todos los lugares?
Ah, \PN! I didn't hear you come in. It is good to see you!
¡Ah, \PN! No te oí entrar. ¡Qué bueno verte!
This is Cynthia. She came all the way from the Sinnoh region to share a very interesting discovery with us.
Te presento a Cynthia. Ha venido desde Sinnoh para contarnos sobre un hallazgo fascinante.
\PN... Yes! I remember you from the Sinjoh Ruins. It's good to see you again.
\PN... ¡Sí! Te recuerdo de las Ruinas Sinjoh. Es bueno verte de nuevo.

So \PN, you got all the Johto badges too, huh? You really can't get enough, can't you?
Entonces \PN, ¿tienes todas las insignias de Johto también? Parece que nunca te basta, ¿no?
I figured you were something special when you beat me at the Pokémon League, but to think you'd get all the badges from Johto too... This is just something else!
Ya sospechaba que eras especial cuando me ganaste en la Liga Pokémon, pero que además obtuvieras todas las insignias de Johto... ¡es asombroso!
There are very few trainers who can claim to have so many badges. It is quite the achievement. Congratulations, \PN!
Son pocos los entrenadores que pueden decir que tienen tantas insignias. Es un gran mérito. ¡Enhorabuena, \PN!
Cynthia's a League Champion just like you, you know? If you're looking for one final opponent to test your skills against, then she's probably it!
Cynthia es una Campeona de la Liga, como tú, ¿sabes? Si buscas un último rival para poner a prueba tus habilidades, probablemente ella sea la indicada.
One day, we might get the chance to face off against each other, but for now we have more pressing matters.
Algún día quizá tengamos la oportunidad de enfrentarnos, pero por ahora hay asuntos más urgentes.
Yes, of course... Go on.
Sí, por supuesto... Continúa.
As I was just telling Professor Oak, scientists from my home region have noticed odd readings on Mt. Silver.
Tal y como le decía al Profesor Oak, los científicos de mi región han observado mediciones raras en el Monte Plateado.
As you approach the summit, it appears that the laws of physics start to behave strangely.
Conforme te aproximas a la cima, las leyes físicas parecen actuar de manera anómala.
Time slows down and objects seem to be pulled inwards as if they were about to get sucked into a black hole.
El tiempo se vuelve más lento y las cosas parecen ser empujadas hacia adentro, como si las fuera a engullir un agujero negro.
The scientists say that such a strange phenomenon could only be caused by a significant distortion in spacetime.
Los científicos dicen que un fenómeno tan extraño solo podría deberse a una distorsión importante del espacio-tiempo.
But the patterns are too irregular for it to be from natural causes. It's as if space and time were being deliberately manipulated by something...
Pero los patrones son demasiado irregulares para atribuirlos a causas naturales. Es como si algo estuviera manipulando el espacio y el tiempo deliberadamente...
Of course there's only so much information we can obtain from instrument readings. That's why I came here to check it out in person!
Claro que solo podemos sacar cierta información de las lecturas instrumentales. ¡Por eso vine aquí a comprobarlo en persona!
There are myths in the Sinnoh region that describe two legendary Pokémon that are able to alter the spatial and temporal dimensions respectively.
En la región Sinnoh hay mitos que describen a dos Pokémon legendarios capaces de alterar, respectivamente, las dimensiones espacial y temporal.
But manipulating both time and space at once... That's unheard of!
Pero manipular el tiempo y el espacio a la vez... ¡Eso es inaudito!
Since we might be dealing with something powerful, I asked \V[12] to come join me on my expedition to Mt. Silver.
Dado que podríamos enfrentarnos a algo poderoso, le pedí a \V[12] que se uniera a mi expedición al Monte Plateado.
If it's a Pokémon, then I'm gonna catch it and I'll be unbeatable!
Si es un Pokémon, ¡lo atraparé y seré invencible!
\PN, would you like to join us? We do not know what we're up against so we could always use an experienced Pokémon trainer such as yourself.
\PN, ¿te gustaría unirte a nosotros? No sabemos con qué nos enfrentamos, así que siempre viene bien un entrenador experimentado como tú.
Great! You can come and meet us near the entrance to Mt. Silver so we can plan the expedition!

\V[12], \PN, let's meet up at the base of Mt. Silver!

Oh... That's disappointing. But of course, as a League Champion myself, I completely understand that you are very busy.
Vaya... qué pena. Pero, como Campeón de la Liga, comprendo perfectamente que tengas muchos compromisos.

It was created by some scientists in Cinnabar Island some time ago. But one day, it fled the mansion and hasn't been seen ever since.

Recently, my colleague Professor Elm in Johto came across some new information concerning the whereabouts of Mewtwo.

He says he'd need the assistance of a strong trainer, so I thought you'd be the perfect candidate.
Dice que necesitaría la ayuda de un entrenador fuerte, así que pensé que serías el candidato perfecto.
His lab is located in New Bark Town in the Johto region. It's a long way from here, but do you think you could pay him a visit?

Let's have a battle to see how much stronger a Pokémon gets when it's fused with another one!
¡Vamos a batallar para ver cuánto más fuerte se vuelve un Pokémon al fusionarse con otro!
I don't believe it! How could my cool fused Pokemon lose!?
I don't believe it! How could my cool fused Pokemon lose!?
Pff... This Pokémon is completely worthless. I'll find some better ones!
Pff... Este Pokémon no vale para nada. ¡Buscaré otros mejores!
Ha! I always knew I was better!
¡Ja! ¡Siempre supe que era mejor!
I'm going to catch some more Pokémon to see if I can get them to be stronger than this one.
Voy a atrapar más Pokémon para ver si puedo lograr que sean más fuertes que este.
Wait.. you didn't choose a Pokemon?
Espera... ¿no elegiste ningún Pokémon?
